# Rock-Paper-Scissors
This Python program allows you to play the classic game of Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. You'll be prompted to enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors), and the computer will randomly select its choice. The program will then determine the winner based on the classic game rules.
